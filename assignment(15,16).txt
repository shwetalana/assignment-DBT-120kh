                             Assignment-15
(1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into this table.
->CREATE TABLE Multicast AS SELECT * FROM salespeople WHERE snum IN(SELECT snum FROM customers GROUP BY snum HAVING count(snum)>1);


 
(2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.  

->DELETE customers WHERE cnum=ANY(SELECT cnum FROM orders WHERE cnum NOT IN(SELECT cnum FROM customers));

(3)Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000. 
->UPDATE salespeople SET comm=comm*1.20 WHERE snum IN(SELECT snum FROM orders WHERE amt>300);


                        Assignment-16
(1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.  
-> CREATE INDEX d_order ON orders(odate);

(2)If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?  
->ALTER TABLE orders MODIFY onum CONSTRAINT o_pk PRIMARY KEY;
DESCRIBE orders;

(3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly. 
->CREATE INDEX I_DATE ON orders(odate);

(4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it. 
->ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY rating PRIMARY KEY;
